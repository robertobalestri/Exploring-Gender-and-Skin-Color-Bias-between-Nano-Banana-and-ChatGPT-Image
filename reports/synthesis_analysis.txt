SKIN TONE BIAS ANALYSIS - SYNTHESIS REPORT
======================================================================
Comparing "Original (Raw)" vs "Balanced Norm (Background-Only WB)"

1. IMPACT OF NORMALIZATION ON SKIN TONE DETECTION
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The application of the "Balanced Normalization" (50% Original + 50% HistEq + Background-Only White Balance) caused a significant shift in detected skin tones towards lighter values.

- MST Index (Mean):
  - Original: 5.26 (Medium)
  - Balanced: 4.07 (Lighter)
  - Result: Normalized images read as ~1.2 points lighter on the 10-point Monk scale.

- Fitzpatrick Skin Type (FST) Distribution:
  - Original: Mode = Type III (62.4% of samples)
  - Balanced: Mode = Type II (55.2% of samples)
  - Key Shift: The normalization moved the majority of the dataset from "Medium Light" (III) to "Light" (II).
  - Type I (Very Light) increased drastically from 0.2% -> 17.9%.

Interpretation:
The raw generated images likely contain lighting conditions or color casts (warmth) that computer vision algorithms interpret as darker skin tones. Correcting for white balance (using the background as reference) and histogram equalization reveals that the underlying "pigmentation" generated by the models is significantly lighter than the raw pixel values suggest.

2. DEMOGRAPHIC BIAS (Model Generation Tendencies)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The demographic distribution (Gender/Race) is intrinsic to the generation models and unaffected by post-process normalization.

- Gender Bias:
  - Gemini Flash: STRONGLY biased towards WOMEN (93.7%).
  - GPT Image: STRONGLY biased towards MEN (70.6%).
  - Conclusion: The two models exhibit opposite, extreme gender biases for neutral prompts like "a person".

- Racial Bias:
  - Both Models: OVERWHELMINGLY biased towards WHITE representation.
  - Gemini Flash: 95.9% White
  - GPT Image: 96.9% White
  - Conclusion: Despite differences in gender bias, both models fail to generate diverse racial representation naturally without specific prompting.

3. SKIN TONE & GENDER CORRELATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A persistent trend appeared across both original and normalized data:

- Men consistently measure as LIGHTER than Women.
  - Original: Men MST 5.07 vs Women MST 5.38
  - Balanced: Men MST 3.71 vs Women MST 4.29

Interpretation:
This is notable as it contradicts some biological averages (where men often have slightly darker skin due to higher melanin/hemoglobin). In generated imagery, this suggests a potential aesthetic bias where generated women might be rendered with more "bronzed" skin, makeup, or warmer lighting compared to generated men.

4. CONCLUSION
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- **Normalization Matters**: Raw pixel analysis likely overestimates skin darkness due to lighting/color casting. The "Balanced" approach suggests the models are generating even lighter skin tones (FST I-II) than initially apparent (FST III).
- **Severe Representation Issues**: Both models show near-total collapse of racial diversity (96%+ White).
- **Polarized Gender Roles**: The models do not default to a gender-balanced output; they swing wildly to one extreme or the other.
